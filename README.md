# Stydents_performence

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict student performance based on various factors, such as study hours, attendance, and socioeconomic indicators. It provides insights for educators and policymakers to improve educational outcomes.

Features :


Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical variables.

Modeling: Implements various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, K nearest Neighbous, and naive Bayes classifier.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like f1 and Accuracy.

Visualization: Displays pie chart of the target variable "passed" and correlation heatmaps showing the correlation of other features with "passed".

Dataset
The model uses a dataset with features such as:

Academic scores,
Access to internet,
Parental education level,
Study hours
and other important parameters
